# Daily

## A very simple tasklist template to be customized to your taste

+ Daily intends to be a super minimal tasklist app with only the bare minimum (CRUD) so it can be customized further for any use case. 

+ It uses PostgreSQL and Python as backend, with all the calls being done from a pure Javascript file, with no frameworks. 

## To install: 

+ Create the tables in your PostgreSQL server with the script provided, and do `python run.py`. The app should start and allow you to perform CRUD operations.
