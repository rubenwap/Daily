# Daily

##Â A very simple tasklist template to be customized to your taste

Daily intends to be a super minimal tasklist app with only the bare minimum (CRUD) so it can be customized further for any use case. 

It uses PostgreSQL and Python as backend, with all the calls being done from a pure Javascript file, with no frameworks.
